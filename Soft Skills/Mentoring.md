# Mentoring
- Generally speaking, your mentees's success, is *your* success.
- You will have to find a way to not directly give someone an answer to their question, but lead them to start finding a path to solve their answers to their questions
- Never, ever, be afraid to say "I don't know. Let's find out together."
